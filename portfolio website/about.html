                I'm currently a Computer Science student with a deep interest in frontend development and UI/UX design. I love combining code with creativity to build websites that are not only functional but also intuitive and beautiful.
Iâ€™ve been learning web technologies through courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring design trends, solving logic puzzles, or reading about tech innovations.
